# Predicting Success Rate of Startups using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Abstract

It is essential for startups to assess if they are on the path to success. The failure rate of startups is around 90% nowadays, making it necessary to determine the success rate of a startup. Success for startups can be twofold: launching an IPO (Initial Public Offering) or getting merged/acquired by another company. This project attempts to determine the success of a startup in terms of getting merged or acquired. Using historical data available on startups, a startup dataset from Kaggle was utilized. The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to ensure quality and consistency. Relevant features such as valuations, funding rounds, investments, etc., were extracted from the dataset. Five machine learning models were then designed and implemented to predict the success of startups: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Logistic Regression, and MLP Neural Networks. The models were trained on the preprocessed dataset, and their performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics. Finally, the accuracy of each model was visualized to provide insights into their performance.
